This program asks the user to enter a keyword .tsv file,
a comment .csv file, a country, and a .txt report filename.
From this data, the program sifts through the comment .csv
file and identifies any keywords from the keyword .tsv file,
classifying the comment's emotions. It then results the
total emotions of the comments from the indicated country
from the user.
